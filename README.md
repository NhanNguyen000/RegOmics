# RegOmics

## Description
This repository is the code source for the RegOmics (Regulatory extraction for Omics data) tool for identifying transcription (TF) - target relations and suggesting potential TF candidates in user-uploaded data. 

RegOmics is able to operate with the long list of genes/proteins derived from omic data. This tool can identify the TF-target relations that existed in the user input data, can rank these TF-target relations, and could suggest candidate TFs to researchers

RegOmics is also available as a web-based version [https://nhannguyen.shinyapps.io/RegOmics_Rshinyapp/](https://nhannguyen.shinyapps.io/RegOmics_Rshinyapp/).

## Instructions
- The **code** stores all R separated functions that are used in the RegOmics pipeline
- The **example** folder stores some example files to run in the RegOmics tool
- The **reference** folder stores the default TF-target relation databases
- The **pipeline** file is run the the RegOmics pipeline as an R script.
- The **RegOmics_Rshinyapp** folder stores all source code and setting for the online [RegOmics Rshiny app](https://nhannguyen.shinyapps.io/RegOmics_Rshinyapp/). Users also could download this folder and run the app at a local computer.
