## How to use the tools
This webpage tool is suitable for small data (<5MB). Users upload input files and click to run the tool in the **Input and Run** section. The results will appear in on tabs in the **Outcome** section to see the result.

For bigger dataset, it is better to use the code in [GitHub](https://github.com/NhanNguyen000/RegOmics) and run in a local computer. Users could check sample examples to used in the RegOmics tool at the folder "example" in [GitHub](https://github.com/NhanNguyen000/RegOmics).
